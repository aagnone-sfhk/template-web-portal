Use the Heroku app's config vars as the source of truth for all environment variables.

You can pull them with the following command into a .env file, assuming you have a single git remote configured:

```
heroku config -s > .env
```

If you have multiple git remotes, you can use the following command to pull the config vars for a specific app:

```
heroku config --app <app-name> -s > .env
```
